If you're deploying Kubernetes Ingress in a non-cloud environment, such as your lab or on-premises setup, you'll need to set up a Load Balancer. My preferred choice for this is MetalLB. You can find detailed configuration instructions for MetalLB in the official documentation: MetalLB Configuration
